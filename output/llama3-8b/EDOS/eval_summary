Comment:
- refusal due to safety guardrails never occurs
- either on or two entries do not get an answer (seem obfuscation cases)
- order of labels: it has a positive impact all over the experiment setting
- types of examples: difficult examples seem to have an advantage but EDOS has many examples that qualifies as difficult;
the median is quite high - thus random examples can overlap with difficult ones. Results are not indicative or conclusive
